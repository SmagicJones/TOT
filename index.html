                Welcome friends to the first installment of Boblogs, wherein I
                Bob HollandÂ chronicle my adventures through the culinary
                landscape of our fair Isle (well the North West, let's not go
                mad).
              </p>
              <p>
                As a lover of fine food (see Burger King rewards Points balance
                if proof needed) I am often on the lookout for establishments of
                culinary excellence so when Tom, an esteemed colleague
                recommended Taste of Turkey, Bamber Bridge I simply had to go.Â 
              </p>
              <p>
                For one, the name intrigued me, was the title of this restaurant
                a clue to the food's country of origin or of a signal a singular
                flavour that would permeate all dishes; would everything taste
                like turkey?Â 
              </p>
              <p>
                After probing Tom vigorously on this subject, to the point in
                which I fear it caused two lesser interested colleagues to
                depart for desks on the other side of the office, a table was
                booked and on a sunny Sunday evening in early May I made my
                journey to Bamber Bridge.

                Taste of Turkey is quaintly situated next to the level crossing
                adding a frisson of danger to the surroundings. The interior is
                that of a rustic if a little plastic taverna, it is charming in
                its way but I feel a plastic turkey or two would add a little je
                ne sais quoi.
              </p>
              <p>
                The service was friendly and efficient given how busy it was,
                the chatter of a birthday girl and her gal pals adding to the
                atmosphere, those ladies certainly know how to live, laugh and
                love!Â

                But what about the food Bob? I hear you say (well I hope its
                you, the doctors said the voices would stop once the meds had
                kicked in), well here is a run down of what we had:

                We finished with coffees (zero turkey taste) and to my shame I
                denied my amazing companion the chocolate and pistachio cake she
                had been thinking about all week and I shall have to make it up
                to her by taking her somewhere very fancy.Â

                In conclusion, Taste of Turkey...nothing tasted like turkey and
                so I am 98.7% sure the name refers to the culinary country of
                origin, but no matter because in words of that old turkey
                worrier Bernard Matthews (rip) it was bootiful.Â
